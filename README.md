# Modules
This is a set of Jai modules, for use widely across all of my projects. 
A lot of the modules, names, procedures, design were inspired by the core module library in [Odin](https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin).  
There should be a `Apollo_Time` module, but since this is mostly a copy-pasta from the contents of `Basic/Apollo_Time.jai`, I don't think I can put this here. 
This module is imported in `OS`, which is indirectly imported almost everywhere, so for now the code in this repository isn't really usable...
